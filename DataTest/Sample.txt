Accidents that pit passenger vehicles against large commercial
trucks are inherently dangerous for those in the smaller car. However, override and
underride truck accidents put those in passenger vehicles at an even greater risk.
In fact, the latest statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show
that almost 65 percent of truck-passenger car accidents reported in 2008 and 2009 were either
an underride or an override truck accident.
