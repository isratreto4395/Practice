Scanner and BufferReader both classes are used to read input from external system.
Scanner is normally used when we know input is of type string or of primitive types
and BufferReader is used to read text from character streams while buffering the
characters for efficient reading of characters.

_ BufferedReader gives a better way to read exception
- Scanner does not always give a correct exception
-Scanner is bit slower as it need to parse data as well.
- BufferReader is faster than Scanner as it only reads a character stream
