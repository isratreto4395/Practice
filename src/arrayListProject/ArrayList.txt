ArrayList
- A resizable array
- size of an array is fixed. Example- if we make the size of the array 10 then
its fixed at 10 in the memory.. we cant make it 11
-Arraylist is more dynamic.. so it is not fixed
- so the size of the arraylist can change according to the element inside it
- you can store elements in a arraylist
- ArrayList is an object


syntax:

ArrayList<specify the type of the arraylist> name of the Arraylist
(what is the type)(You will use the class of the type.. so ex if u want the elements to be int then u will use Interger
